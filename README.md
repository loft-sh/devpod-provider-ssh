# DevPod SSH Provider

[![Join us on Slack!](docs/static/media/slack.svg)](https://slack.loft.sh/) [![Open in DevPod!](https://devpod.sh/assets/open-in-devpod.svg)](https://devpod.sh/open#https://github.com/loft-sh/devpod-provider-ssh)

This repository hosts the default SSH provider configuration used in DevPod.

## Usage

To add this SSH provider from the CLI, use the `provider add` command along with your remote host to deploy to. For example:

```shell
devpod provider add ssh -o HOST=user@my-domain.com
```

Please note, the SSH host must be accessible via ssh user@my-domain.com with passwordless login and the user being either root or in the docker group.

## Compatibility

We only support Linux machine as remote hosts.

### Windows

There are known issues with the default windows SSH installation in some setups. If you're unable to connect to your host by default,
try to enable the `USE_BUILTIN_SSH` option
```shell
devpod provider add ssh --option USE_BUILTIN_SSH=true
# or if already installed
devpod provider set-options ssh --option USE_BUILTIN_SSH=true
```

This forces the provider to use the builtin SSH client over the one accessible in your shell. 
You will need to add the identities file manually to your SSH config in case it's not the default key:
```ssh
Host my-domain.com
    User my-user 
    IdentityFile ~/.my-dir/my-key
```
